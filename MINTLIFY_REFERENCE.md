# Mintlify Agent Infrastructure Reference

This document describes how Mintlify documentation sites expose content to AI agents. Mintaborate needs to consume these interfaces.

## llms.txt
- Available at `{docs_url}/llms.txt`
- A markdown file listing all documentation pages with descriptions
- Acts like a sitemap but structured for LLMs
- Contains: H1 site title, optional description, categorized links to doc pages

## llms-full.txt
- Available at `{docs_url}/llms-full.txt`
- The entire documentation site concatenated into a single markdown file
- Much larger than llms.txt — contains full page content, not just links
- LLMs (especially ChatGPT) heavily prefer this over llms.txt according to Mintlify's own data

## skill.md
- Available at `{docs_url}/skill.md` and `{docs_url}/.well-known/skills/default/skill.md`
- A condensed capability summary: what agents can do with the product, required inputs, constraints
- Structured with YAML frontmatter (name, description, version, license, compatibility)
- Includes component tables, configuration boundaries, common pitfalls
- Auto-generated by Mintlify from the docs, but can be customized by the site owner
- Key insight: the auto-generated version is often mediocre — Mintlify literally asks users to improve it

## MCP Server
- Mintlify docs sites host an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server
- Lets agents query documentation search directly from tools like Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf
- Installable via: `npx skills add {docs_url}`

## Content Negotiation
- Any Mintlify page URL with `.md` appended returns clean markdown instead of HTML
- Example: `docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/quickstart.md` returns markdown
- This is how agents should consume individual pages — much cleaner than HTML scraping

## How to Consume Docs in Mintaborate
Priority order for fetching documentation content:
1. Try `{url}/llms-full.txt` first — most complete, single file
2. Try `{url}/llms.txt` for structure/navigation understanding
3. Try `{url}/skill.md` for capability summary
4. For individual pages, append `.md` to the page URL
5. Fall back to HTML scraping only as last resort
